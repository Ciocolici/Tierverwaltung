# Tierverwaltung
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. The program simulates the addition of new animals in an animal management of some sort.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Tierverwaltung.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
